                    Network security is the practice of protecting the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of computer networks and data. It involves technologies, policies, and procedures designed to prevent unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a network and its resources. Some common threats to network security are: Malware (viruses, trojans, & ransomware), Phishing and social engineering, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, & Unauthorized access or insider threats.

                    <div class="editable-content">
                        A firewall is a security system either software, hardware, or both,that controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. It acts like a digital gatekeeper, allowing or blocking traffic based on a set of security rules. Firewalls help protect your network from unauthorized access, malware, and cyberattacks. pfSense is an open-source firewall you can install on a virutal machine. It can help you practice configuring rules, NAT, VPNs, and monitoring traffic. Link: https://www.pfsense.org/

                    <h3>VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)</h3>
                    <div class="editable-content">
                        A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that encrypts your internet connection and routes it through a secure server. It hides your IP address and protects your online activity from hackers, ISPs, or surveillance—especially on public Wi-Fi. It's often used for privacy, secure remote access, or bypassing geo-restrictions. A place where you can practice using a vpn is OpenVPN. It is an open-source VPN you can install on your own server or locally. OpenVPN is a great for learning how VPNs really work and how they are set up as. Link:  https://openvpn.net/community/
