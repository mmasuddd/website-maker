                    Encryption is the process of converting readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) to protect it from unauthorized access. Only someone with the correct decryption key can turn the data back into its original form.

It's one of the core tools of cybersecurity, used to secure everything from passwords and emails to bank transactions and entire networks.

                        Plaintext vs. Ciphertext: Plaintext is the original, readable data before any encryption is applied, like a normal message or file. Ciphertext is the scrambled, unreadable version of that data after it has been encrypted to protect it from unauthorized access.

                        AES, or Advanced Encryption Standard, is a symmetric block cipher algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt electronic data. It's widely adopted as a standard, offering strong security against known attacks and is implemented in both software and hardware.

                        Asymmetric Encryption vs. Symmetric Encryption: Symmetric encryption uses the same key to both encrypt and decrypt data, making it fast and efficient but requiring secure key sharing. Asymmetric encryption uses a public key to encrypt and a separate private key to decrypt, allowing secure communication without sharing secret keys.

                        The best practices for encryption involve using strong, modern algorithms such as AES-256 for symmetric encryption or RSA-2048 and higher for asymmetric encryption. It’s crucial to avoid outdated methods like DES or MD5 and to never attempt writing your own encryption algorithms, as small mistakes can lead to serious vulnerabilities. Encryption keys should be stored securely, ideally in hardware security modules or key vaults, and never hardcoded into applications. Data should be encrypted both while being transmitted (using HTTPS or TLS) and while at rest (such as on a server or storage device). It’s also important to rotate encryption keys regularly, apply proper access controls, and use salting when hashing passwords to defend against brute-force and rainbow table attacks.
