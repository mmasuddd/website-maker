                    Ethical hacking is the practice of legally testing and evaluating computer systems, networks, or applications to find and fix security vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them. Ethical hackers, also known as white hat hackers, use the same tools and techniques as cybercriminals but with permission and the goal of improving security. Their work helps organizations protect sensitive data, strengthen defenses, and stay ahead of potential cyber threats.

                        A hacker typically breaks into systems without permission, often for personal gain, theft, or disruption. Their actions are illegal and can cause serious harm, such as data breaches or system damage.

                        An ethical hacker, on the other hand, is authorized to test systems for weaknesses. They work with the organizationâ€™s permission and follow legal and ethical guidelines to identify and fix security flaws before malicious hackers can exploit them.
